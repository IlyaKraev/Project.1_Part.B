Greetings to whomever is grading this,

Just as a heads-up, since I wasn't sure what username and password would be
appropriate to have for this occasion in the jdbc connector class
(src/dbutils/Database.java), I just left it as "root" "root".

The necessary files for creating my database are located inside the database 
folder, separated by function for clarity and ease of review. I hope reviewing
this project will be as enjoyable as it was creating it.

Kind regards, Ilya K.
